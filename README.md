Every now and then, I'm running multiple experiments. 

It is difficult keep track of what I did and when I did. 

This [website](https://logify.vercel.app) is for event logs for e.g.,

```
07 May 2021 16:03:10: Created this repo for event logs
```

[Logs for this project](https://github.com/nishantrpai/logify/blob/master/Log.md)

## How to use

Go to the website -> Write the message -> Press copy -> Paste the event log in your experiment/logfile
