May 08 2021 10:47:09: Tried searching Pinterest images for logfile, but nothing impressive so far

May 08 2021 10:52:06: Searching Youtube videos related to Logfile

May 08 2021 10:53:07: Most Logfiles that are generated are related to IT and hardware management for debugging errors. These are system generated not human generated.

May 08 2021 10:58:34: Copy function doesn't work on Firefox. Clipboarderror in Firefox, need to check the code

May 08 2021 11:14:22: Removed `ClipboardItem`, directly using the string for copying. Didn't work

May 08 2021 11:28:03: Was thinking of making this Meme Generator, but the app and webapp are enough.

May 08 2021 11:29:17: Listening to Gorillaz Plastic Beach. Like the riff in the beginning.

May 08 2021 11:29:53: Using navigator clipboard writeText instead of write. It should work on the deployment though, not locally

May 08 2021 11:30:35: navigator.clipboard.writeText works locally as well. Awesome

May 08 2021 11:34:46: Need to make a toast when you press copy

May 08 2021 11:36:52: Going to reuse the NotificationToast I was using in threadify

May 08 2021 11:43:34: Added the component in the component section. Need to edit it so it fits in this context

May 08 2021 12:10:13: Struggling with making this copy notification work

May 08 2021 12:51:20: I changed the text from Copy to Copied. Can't believe it was a simple solution, using toast was a waste of time.

May 08 2021 12:54:03: Checking if the color for copy can be changed when I click Copy

May 08 2021 12:54:23: Nope. Not changing colors.

May 08 2021 13:02:41: Trying on logify vercel app to see if colors change when I press copy

May 08 2021 13:02:50: They don't change

May 08 2021 18:11:14: Visalist has a nice open graph details.

May 08 2021 18:19:41: Updating the packaging of the website. Meta description, images and copy.

May 09 2021 07:54:57: Want to also add a timestamp event so I can mark it when I make a new note.

May 09 2021 11:11:04: Added timestamp as well for logify, it's live

May 09 2021 11:15:14: Going to be using the next 7 days to see, if this fits well and then I'll publish the blog

May 09 2021 11:38:10: Setting up the og image for logify

May 09 2021 11:54:31: Adding the outcome as the description i.e., for logify it would be keeping track of context across projects

May 09 2021 17:06:56: Turning this app into a PWA
